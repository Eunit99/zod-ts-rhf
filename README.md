# Mastering Form Validation in TypeScript Projects: A Comprehensive Guide with Zod and TypeScript

## Introduction

Form validation is an important aspect of software development. This is because it ensures type safety and helps preserve data integrity by preventing your application users from submitting inaccurate or incomplete information.

Imagine a form asking for an exact number of guests, yet a user enters a range. Validation helps prevent such mismatches. Form validation can be implemented on either the client side (using JavaScript) or the server side.

In this article, you will learn how to build type-safe forms using the powerful combination of [React-Hook-Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) library for form management and [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for robust validation on the client-side.
